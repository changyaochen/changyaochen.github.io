I found the organization of the chapter 6 is less intuitive, so I did
a bit of my own reading and think the energy-based models is closed related
to the diffusion models (chapter 7). I will combine these two chapters in this post.

My understandings are mostly from [this](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/) blog.
