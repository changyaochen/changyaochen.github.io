Thriller-like plot, 10 billion dollars on the line, and twisted romantic relationship, this sounds like what a movie is made of. WSJ's John Carreyrou's new book, [Bad Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X), walks us through the real-life story of the once Silicon Valley's hottest startup [Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos), through its rise, its mythical technology, and its final downfall. Theranos's founder, [Elizabeth Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes) promises the world a revolutionary healthcare product to the world, a device that can perform most if not all the blood tests, just based on few drops of blood pricked from the finger.

However, the company is built on lies: there is just no such magical devices, the "fake it till you make it" culture that Silicon Valley cultivated only made matter worse. The lack of rigorous scientific practice is shocking, even for big companies like Walgreen and Safeway, who lost millions due to their partnership with Theranos. Although I've been following this subject closely as it unfolds, I found myself very engaged throughout.
