[The subtle art of not giving a f\*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F\*ck) by Mark Manson. This is one of those "feeling good" books, that one can always resonates with something avocated in the book. The most obvious difference of this book is probably the profanities, however, hidding behind the language, the author argues that to live a good life, one should carefully choose **a few priorities**, and then simply ignore other things. By doing so, one don't have to seek for approvals, or admirations in **everything**, but just focus on those things that really matter to you. I feel it is refreshing, to read something like that, mindlessly.
