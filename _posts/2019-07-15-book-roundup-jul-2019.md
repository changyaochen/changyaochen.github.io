[The subtle art of not giving a f\*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F\*ck) by Mark Manson. This is one of those "feeling good" books, that one can always resonate with something advocated in the book. The most obvious difference of this book is probably the profanities, however, hiding behind the language, the author argues that to live a good life, one should carefully choose **a few priorities**, and then simply ignore other things. By doing so, one don't have to seek for approvals, or admirations in **everything**, but just focus on those things that really matter to you. I feel it is refreshing, to read something like that, mindlessly. 

[Zucked](https://www.amazon.com/Zucked-Waking-Up-Facebook-Catastrophe-ebook/dp/B07FC5BZYV) by Roger McNamee. Facebook has been under fierce criticism, since the unveiling of the [Cambridge Analytica debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal). The author is an early investor of Facebook, and personal friend of Mark Zuckerberg, hence it seemingly adds more credibility to his conclusions. All things aside, the book argues that, the tech giants, including Google, are creating "filter bubbles" around their users, who would easily fall prey to those self-reinforcing habits and ideologies. During the processes, those tech companies monetize through advertisements, which is a much brighter outcome, compared to the sharpening societal divisions. However, Facebook tries to claim innocence by positioning itself as a pure platform, hence without the burden of supervising or moral responsibility. The author couldn't argue against this line of reasoning stronger. In addition, the author also proposes breaking up these tech giants, looping in enterprises like Google. It is indeed a refreshing call to every one of us, while relying on (seemingly) benign tools like Google, to examine the possible dark sides.
