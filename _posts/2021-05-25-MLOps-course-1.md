A machine learning model is only useful when it is in production, however, going from Jupyter Notebook to deployment in the production environment (and running reliably) can take more effort than one expects. "Just give the model to the software engineers" is not a very effective solution. The term [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) (Machine Learning + DevOps) thus describes the processes that bridge this gap. Fittingly, Andrew Ng and the team at DeepLearning.AI has created a [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) on this topic, and I was only too quick to take it. Here I want to summarize my takeaways from the first (of the four) course: Introduction to Machine Learning in Production.

# The Big Picture

Four parts: scoping, data, modeling, deployment.

Small data: make sure data, especially labels, are clean.
Big data: investigate efforts on data processing.
