I started running in graduate school, and there is no better place to pick up this hobby than New York City, right next to the Central Park. Over the years, I've also run many races organized by [NYRR](https://www.nyrr.org/), in which I see my pace improves. This trend is very easy to notice from the race bib numbers. Let me explain.

In most of NYRR's races, the bib number is assigned by the runner's pace, usually from past races if this condition is applicable to that runner. In general, the runners are clustered into different corrals at the start: faster runners in the front, and slower runners in the back. In doing so, when starting the race at the same time, fast runners won't have to spend unnecessary energies to navigate through the crowd. Due to this reason, the design of the bib need to reflect the corral assignments.   

In the past (around 2010), the corral assignments are indirectly reflected through the bib number. The bib numbers are allocated by 1000-block: bib numbers 1 to 999 are assigned to the first corral (the fastest), bib numbers 1000 to 1999 are assigned to the second corral, so on and so forth. Each 1000-block is also associated with one unique bib color: 1 to 999 bibs are painted in blue, 1000 to 1999 bibs are painted in red, etc. This is illustrated from the left figure below ([source](http://racepacejess.com/2015-nyrr-r-u-n-5k-recap-pr-maybe/)). When I finally got my first blue bib number, after various red bibs, I was very proud of myself.

One ramifications of such design is that, the runner's name and the bib number is already permanently linked **prior** to the bib numbers pickup. They are determined when the bib numbers are printed. When I go to pick up my bib before a race, the staff has to go through stacks of bib numbers, to find out that one that belongs to me, on which my name is printed. You can imagine the tedious labor of such operation, and the waste of time. 

Since I moved back to New York about a year ago, and started running NYRR races again, I noticed a big change in the bib design.
